/**
 * @title Avatar group
 * @description Overlapping avatar stack whose neighbours lift with a distance falloff on hover.
 *
 * Adapted from Transitions.dev "Avatar group hover".
 *
 * A dock, not a switch. Lifting only the hovered item makes the row twitch — one element jumps
 * while the rest sit rigid — so the response falls off with distance: the neighbour rises about
 * half as far, the next barely at all. The falloff is what makes the row read as one soft object.
 *
 * The return is deliberately springier than the approach: a strong overshoot curve on the way back
 * reads as elastic rather than mechanical.
